# `modules/` directory

### What's in `modules/`?

This directory contains all sub-workflows to be run with `nextflow run main.nf`. It is considered good practice to split out processes into separate `.nf` files and store them here, rather than including them all in the `main.nf` file. This directory is referenced in `main.nf` by using [`include {x} from ./modules/process`](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/dsl2.html#modules). These process scripts currently contain all code to be run in the `script:` block. 

Each `.nf` script contains the process to be run, in addition to details of which container to be used, where to publish the output for the process.
