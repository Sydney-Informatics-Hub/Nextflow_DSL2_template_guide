## **Set up**

Requirements: 

* [A GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github) 
* Installed on your chosen development environment: 
  * [Nextflow (>v20.10.0)](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/install.html)
  * [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) 

### **Clone the template**

1. Open the [DSL2 template repository](https://github.com/Sydney-Informatics-Hub/Nextflow_DSL2_template) on GitHub
2. Select the <span style="color: green">Use this template</span> box and create a new repository 
3. Name your repository, ending in `-nf` (this is required by cookiecutter gh action)
4. Select the <span style="color: green">Create repository from template</span> box

Once you create a new repository using this template, a GitHub Action workflow will automatically be deployed. This workflow will populate your new repository with the skeleton template directory. 

We recommend working in a development environment like VS Code to work with this template. If you're working with VS Code, use the [nf-core-extensionpack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nf-core.nf-core-extensionpack) for some nice features like syntax highlighting. You can clone your copy of the template to your environment using git. 

For example: 

```default
git clone https://github.com/georgiesamaha/myWorkflow-nf.git
```

### **Download Nextflow**

Depending on the system you're working on there are a few options for installing and running Nextflow including reproducible options like bioconda and Singularity. See [here](https://nf-co.re/usage/installation) for installation instructions. 

Once you have installed Nextflow, you can configure it to run on your system. See [here](https://www.nextflow.io/blog/2021/nextflow-developer-environment.html) for some set up tips.

## **Use the template**

This template currently contains 3 processes as as part of the demo workflow. To use this workflow yourself, you will need to delete any processes associated with the demo. Each line of code inside the `nextflow.config` and `main.nf` associated with the demo workflow is prefixed by a comment line `// DEMO CODE: DELETE FOR YOUR OWN WORKFLOWS`.

Delete the 3 demo process files (`modules/check_input.nf`, `modules/group_samples.nf`, `modules/generate_report.nf`) and use the `template_process.nf` to structure your own processes. 

See the **template_components** sections in this user guide for what how to use all directories and files provided in this template.
