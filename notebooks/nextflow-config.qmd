# **`nextflow.config`**

### What's in `nextflow.config`? 

This is the main configuration script that Nextflow looks for when you run `nextflow run main.nf`. It contains a number of property definitions that are used by the pipeline. A key feature of Nextflow is the ability to separate workflow implementation from the underlying execution platformm using this configuration file. Since we can add additional configuration files for different run environments (i.e. job schedulers, use of singularity vs bioconda) each configuration file can contain conflicting settings and parameters listed in this file can be overwritten in the run command by specifying relevant commands. See [here](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/config.html#configuration-file) for details on the heirarchy of confuration files. This file contains: 

* Mainfest for defining some metadata including authorship, link to the repo, workflow version, etc 
* Mandated minimal version of Nextflow that can be used to run this pipeline 
* Resume function that allows the pipeline to start up at the last successful process if the run fails part way through (currently enabled) 
* Various profile definitions that can be activated when launching a pipeline. These can be used together, depending on their requirements. We can define various profiles depending on the system you're using. See [here](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/config.html?highlight=profiles#config-profiles) for more details on what sorts of things can be included here. 
* Default parameters for running the pipeline. These include default file names, containers, paths, etc. These can be overwritten when launching the pipeline. 
* Customisable workflow run info reports with `dag{}`, `report{}`, `timeline{}`, and `trace{}`. You can specify where to output these run summary files.
